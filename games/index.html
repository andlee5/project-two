        <h3>Some games I recommend for other people</h3>
        <p>
          First off, everyone has their own taste and like different kinds of
          games. It is important to know what type of platform they prefer to
          play on since not all games are available on more than one console.
          If this is not a concern, then all that is left to decide is what
          kind of games they like. For people who like single player games
          such as myself, I'd especially recommend the games I have listed
          above, though it is just my opinion. I enjoy single-player games
          because I love to experience a story-rich experience and atmospheric
          environment. You can't really enjoy those with a multiplayer game...
          I do still play multiplayer games though. Now let's talk about the
          different categories. In order to keep this short, we'll need to
          talk about gameplay only. If you enjoy FPS games, I would recommend
          Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. For racing games, Forza Horizon 4 is
          fabulous. The graphics to the realistic physics make this game an
          icon in the racing category. For fighting games, I would recommend
          Tekken 7. There are many different combos and moves you can use
          and lot of mechanics in the game. For horror games, I definitely
          recommend Outlast 2. The game takes place in midwest and approaches
          a different style of horror which I find really unique...And if you
          enjoy being chased by crazy people every 5 minutes, this game won't
          dissapoint. These games should definitely be given a try.
