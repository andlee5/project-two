    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>
      Hello, my name is Andrew Lee. I am currently studying Information Technology as
      an undergraduate at the Illinois Institute of Technology. This is my second year
      here at IIT. I was born in Chicago but my hometown is in Morton Grove. IT is a
      field that is always evolving with the evolution of technology and I think it
      leaves a big impact on the world.
